## Features to change 

### If a price of a coin is less than 2 decimal places, change formatting so i can see two digits of the price

### Change the golden price label at the bottom to make it look slicker

### I want more of a dashbord format, rather than a vertical page, i want it from left to right if thats possible

### I want a report that goes out to me weekly (email), highlighting the top 3 oppertunities in the short term with reasoning eg estimated price valuation vs current price. If the coin was seen in the week before, skip that one

### In ML config file, why have you specified the types of the model paramaters (int, str etc)? Is that normal practise for ML in python?

### May need to change monitoring.py as I'm not using slack and i don't belive i'm using any other monitoring functionality at this point?

### When i deploy everything to my azure vm, is the reinforcemnt learning system going to work & if so, will it use a lot of resources? Same question for other ml things I'm using

### kinda follows the questions above but i want the main functionality to only work when I refresh the page myself to save on resouces if I don't use, but also I'll need it to work for my weekly report. Can this work/learn If it's only be activey used maybe a few times a week including the weekly report

### Do i need the models directory? If so, can you explain about the model files created (`*.pkl`, `*.joblib`)

### Do I really need the tests directory and files when we test and troubleshoot app.py when running that?

### Whats ml_service.py actually doing? Is it needed / does it need to be integrated before I can actually see what's its trying to show

### Do i really need two requirements files?
